# Bento Accordion with Vue.js

This example demonstrates how to use the Bento accordion component with Vue 3. Since this component is defined outside of Vue, we need it to be treated as a custom element by setting the `app.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement` option. For more information, see [here](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/custom-elements-interop.html#_3-x-syntax).

To view this example, run `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:5000/accordion](http://localhost:5000/accordion).
